## General info

This project explores the macroevolutionary significance of song learning in hummingbirds from a phylogenetic comparative perspective. The project aims to compare several aspects of vocal complexity evolution between hummingbirds and their non-vocal learning sister groups (Apodidae and Caprimulgidae) in order to isolate evolutionary dynamics potentially related to vocal learning.

## Analysis


## To-do list

* Obtain branchwise evolutionary rates
* Compare rates between clades
* Evaluate evolutionary covariation of rates

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
